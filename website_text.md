## Introduction
Hi, my name is Talia, I'm a master's student at the [WIS](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/), currently doing my lab rotations. 
My current rotation is in Yaron Antebi's lab, which researches how cells communicate with each other during cell fate determination processes in development and the immune system.
