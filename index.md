## Introduction
Hi, my name is Talia. I'm a master's student at the [Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS)](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/), currently completing my lab rotations. 
My current rotation is in Dr Yaron Antebi's lab, which studies how cells communicate with each other during cell fate determination processes, both in development and in the immune system. If you find yourself interested, you're welcome to read more on the [lab's Webpage](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/molgen/Antebi/).

## Background
I recently completed my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences at The Hebrew University, specializing in Genetics and Genomics.

## Outside the Lab
I enjoy baking, reading, traveling, learning new things and spending time with friends and family.
